For this homework, I received a project to fix some issues with the website.
<br><br>These were the changes I've made:
<ul>
 <li>I fixed the formating of the file.</li>
 <li>I added the title of the page.</li>
 <li>I aligned the left picture to the right to look more organized.</li>
 <li>I fixed the link of the menu "Search Engine Optimization" to go to the section of the page.</li>
 <li>I made the website look nicer adding borders to the images and matching background colors and fonts.</li>
 <li>I included semantic tags throughout the code</li>
 <li>I included the README.md file.</>
